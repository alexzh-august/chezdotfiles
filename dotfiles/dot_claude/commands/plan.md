# Plan Mode

Use this command to switch into planning mode for complex tasks like PRs, refactors, or features.

## Instructions

When entering plan mode:

1. **Understand the goal**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Explore the codebase**: Read relevant files to understand the current structure
3. **Identify affected areas**: What files/modules will need changes?
4. **Consider edge cases**: What could go wrong? What tests are needed?
5. **Outline the approach**: Step by step, what changes need to be made?

## Plan Template

Create a plan with these sections:

### Goal
[One sentence describing the objective]

### Current State
[What exists today, relevant code/files]

### Proposed Changes
[Numbered list of specific changes]

### Files to Modify
[List of files with brief description of changes]

### Testing Strategy
[How to verify the changes work correctly]

### Risks & Mitigations
[Potential issues and how to handle them]

After the plan is approved, switch to auto-accept edits mode to implement it in one shot.
